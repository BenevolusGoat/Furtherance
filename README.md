### Disclaimer!
Furtherance isn't always consisting of brand new content, as we often take content from our past mods & content and apply them to this pack. If any of our concepts appear again but in another mod, we did not copy them- do your homework (eg. Andromeda's astrological signs vs. [our own](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2500898099), ours predating Andromeda by almost a year).
Quite a handful of people on this team are not well-versed in the modding community, anyway. Thus, we will not remove or readily change content that is coincidentally similar to something someone else happened to repeat. As much as we love modding and respect this community, we will not cater to anyone at our own expense- wouldn't you, or maybe even aren't you doing the same?
